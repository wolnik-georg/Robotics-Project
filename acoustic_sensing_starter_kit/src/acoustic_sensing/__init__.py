"""
Acoustic Sensing for Geometric Reconstruction

A comprehensive acoustic sensing system for real-time geometric reconstruction
with optimized feature extraction, advanced saliency analysis, and production-ready
real-time capabilities.

Key Components:
- Core: Feature extraction, preprocessing, data management
- Features: Optimized feature sets, ablation analysis, saliency analysis
- Models: Training pipelines, geometric reconstruction
- Sensors: Real-time sensing system
- Analysis: Batch analysis, discrimination analysis
- Visualization: Publication-quality plots and visualizations
- Demo: Integrated demonstration scripts
- Legacy: Original A/B/C record/train/sense scripts

Usage:
    from acoustic_sensing.features import OptimizedFeatureExtractor
    from acoustic_sensing.sensors import OptimizedRealTimeSensor
    from acoustic_sensing.models import ConfigurableTrainingPipeline
